# Probabilistics methods 

## Content 

### Probability, discrete_random_variables,  continuous_random_variables

In this notebooks I recollect basic concepts of probability calculus. It also introduces some popular probability distributions for further reference. 

### Binary classification

This notebook contains  definitions of various metrics used to rate performance of binary classifiers. This includes ROC (receiver operational characteristic) curves. 

### Classification Naive Bayes

In this notebook we will  actually for the first time start training the classifiers i.e. get to the "learning"  part in Machine Learning. We will reimplement the "sex from height" classifier this times basing on data.

We will also add weight as an additional feature and introduce Naive Bayes classifier. 

### Bayesian analysis*

Generative methods that are the subject of this chapter require estimation of the parameters of probability distributions. This is a domain of _statistics_. In this notebook I introduce the concepts of Baysian statistics. While we will not be using any advanced techniques, the concepts of  prior and posterior probability distributions are very important and are widly refered in many ML tasks.  

You can skip the A/B testing example on the first reading. 


### Categorical

While in classification and classification_naive_bayes notebooks we have constructed classifiers with continous features, in this notebook we will play with an example  of 
classifier with solely categorical (nominal) features. This will also give us oportunity to use the tools for constructing classifiers  provided in the scickit-learn library. We will also learn to measure the performance of non-binary classifiers.
